# Complex-Drawing.io
This project was fun, I was able to be creative with what I wanted to create but I also was able to learn about different java functions and script. I still have a lot to learn and it can be confusing but I have really enjoyed this project. 
- I am not too comfortable with classes yet, I am not even sure if I did this assignment correct but I think by putting the code for each object inside a callout it was a class. I will probably come to office hours again somepoint soon to figure it out better.
